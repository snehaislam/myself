  <p>
    I was born in Dhaka in 2005. I come from a small and supportive family consisting of my father,
    mother, and younger sister. My father is a businessman, and my mother is both a businesswoman
    and a working professional. My younger sister is currently a student.
    <br><br>
    From my childhood, I have been actively involved in various co-curricular activities alongside
    my studies. I have experience in singing, dancing, scouting, recitation, drama, advertising,
    and art. Alhamdulillah, through dedication and hard work, I have achieved many things in different
    fields. I have always tried to balance my academic life with my passions and interests.
    <br><br>
    I believe all the credit for who I am today goes to my mother, whose support, guidance, and
    encouragement have shaped my journey. I am ambitious and determined to go far in life.
    My biggest dream is to make my parents proud and bring honor to my family. Let’s hope for the best.
